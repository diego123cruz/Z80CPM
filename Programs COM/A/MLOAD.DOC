	MLOAD - a multi-file hex load utility for CP/M

Written by Ron Fowler, Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin.  This documentation
was extracted from the source file (MLOAD21.ASM), with trivial 
modifications.

This program is a replacement for the CP/M "LOAD" program.  Why replace
"LOAD"?  Well... LOAD.COM has a few deficiencies.  For example, if your
hex file's origin is above 100h, LOAD.COM prepends blank space to the
output file to insure it will work as a CP/M transient.  It cares not if
the file is not intended as a CP/M transient.  It also doesn't like hex
records with mixed load addresses (for example, one that loads below a
previous record -- which is a perfectly legitimate happenstance).  Also,
LOAD.COM can load only one program at a time, and has no provision for a
load bias in the command specification.  Finally, there is no provision
for user specification of output file name. 

Hence, this program....

Command syntax is as follows:

	MLOAD [<outnam>=] <file1>[,<file2>...] [bias]

where:
	<outnam> is the (optional!) output file name (only the drive
	spec and primary filename may be specified; the output filetype
	is derived exclusively from the 3-byte string at 103h within
	MLOAD). 

	<filen> are the input files.  <file1> may specify an extension,
	in which case it is assumed to be a binary file (starting at
	100h).

	<bias> is the offset within the saved image to apply when
	loading the file. 


MLOAD with no arguments prints a small help message -- this message is
also printed whenever a command line syntax error occurs. 

Filenames may contain drive specs, and must not contain wildcards.  Input
filenames must be separated by commas, and a space is required between
the last filename and the optional bias.  Note that ZCPR2-style
drive/user notation may be used in all file specifications (e.g.,
"B3:MYFILE.COM, "A14:MDM7.HEX"). 

A load information summary is printed at the successful conclusion of
the load.  Any errors in loading will generally include the name of the
file in question. 

If no output filename is specified, it will be derived from the first
input filename, with filetype of 'COM' (this default filetype may be
patched directly into MLOAD via DDT -- its location is at 103h in
MLOAD.COM).  Note that a command line of the form "C:=<filename>" will
place the output file on the "C" drive with the same primary filename as
the first input file. 

In its simplest form, MLOAD's syntax is identical to LOAD.COM; thus
there should be no problem in learning to use the new program.  The only
significant difference here is that, under LOAD.COM, all files are
output starting at 100h, even if they originate elsewhere.  MLOAD
outputs starting at the hex file origin (actually, the first hex record
specifies the output load address).  The bias option may be used to
override this. 

An example should clarify this.  Suppose you have a file that loads at
1000h.  LOAD.COM would save an output file that begins at 100h and loads
past 1000h (to wherever the program ends).  MLOAD will save an output
file starting from 1000h only.  If, for some reason you need the file to
start at 100h in spite of its 1000h origin (I can think of several
circumstances where this would be necessary), you'd have to specify a
bias to MLOAD.  Thus, using this example, "MLOAD MYFILE 0F00" would do. 

Note that this program re-initializes itself each time it is run. Thus,
if your system supports a direct branch to the TPA (via a zero-length
.COM file, or the ZCPR "GO" command), you may safely re-execute MLOAD.
